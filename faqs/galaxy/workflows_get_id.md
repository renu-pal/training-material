1. Go to the {%icon galaxy-workflows-activity %}workflows panel in Galaxy and find the workflow you've just created.
2. Click on {% icon galaxy-pencil %} Edit or {% icon history-share %} Share
3. The URL in your browser will look something like `https://usegalaxy.eu/workflow/editor?id=34d18f081b73cb15`. Copy the part after `?id=` - this is the workflow ID, in our case: `34d18f081b73cb15`
