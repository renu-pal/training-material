    "Contemporary research in the humanities has expanded beyond anything that could be considered traditional. Historians are building interactive
     digital maps, literary scholars are using computers to look for patterns across millions of books, and scholars in all disciplines are taking
     advantage of the internet to make their work more dynamic and visually engaging. Digital humanities (DH) is the umbrella term that describes much of
     this work. It is neither a field, a discipline, nor a methodology. It is not simply the humanities done with computers, nor is it computer science
     performed on topics of interest to the humanities. DH is the result of a dynamic dialogue between emerging technology and humanistic inquiry." -- Taken from [Stewart Varner's Special Report](https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2016/01/04/special-report-digital-humanities-libraries/)
